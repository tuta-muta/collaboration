# Research Overview

## 

I am currently seeking a dedicated and qualified collaborator to join two manuscript projects on the **burden of urological cancers**—specifically, **testicular** and **prostate** cancers in the United States.

These projects are supervised by faculty members in the US, with the potential for co-supervision from colleagues in Canada and Europe. You will be directly mentored by me as the lead researcher (identity anonymized for now).  
You may review my anonymized CV [here](anonymized%20resume.html){target="_blank"}.


# What I’m Looking For

## 

We’re building a team that values collaborative mentorship with academic rigor. I’m looking for a research partner who embodies a **mutual commitment to excellence** and brings both independence and reliability to the work.


**Required:**

- Degree in **medicine** or **public health** (preferably completed).
- Strong understanding of health burden metrics: ***DALY***, ***YLL***, ***YLD***, ***incidence***, ***prevalence***.
- At least **5 publications**; first- or corresponding-authorship is highly valued.
- Demonstrated ability to **deliver high-quality work on deadline**.
- Skilled in **scientific writing**.



# Your Role

## 

You will primarily contribute to the following:

- Drafting the **Introduction** and **Discussion** sections of the manuscripts.
- Supporting revisions during the peer-review process.

Regular communication is essential. I encourage thoughtful questions and constructive dialogue—it signals investment and engagement.


# What You Can Expect From Me

## 

- **Second authorship** on the manuscripts (4–6 total authors anticipated).
- Ongoing inclusion in future research efforts, pending a positive experience.
- A **growth-focused partnership**—I am committed to sharing knowledge and supporting your development, no matter the time investment.

> While I uphold high standards, I aim to mentor with empathy and professionalism.


# Work Samples

## 

These projects analyze more than **14 million records** using **R**, producing over **2,700 figures**. A custom web-based application will host interactive visualizations that cannot be included in the manuscripts.

Below are a few representative outputs directly from the analysis:

#

I’ve had the privilege of working with outstanding collaborators—and have also learned when to respectfully part ways when standards aren’t met.

This opportunity is best suited to those who appreciate clarity, structure, and mutual respect in scientific work. If you thrive under those conditions, I look forward to hearing from you.

# 

> *In my opinion, these projects typically take no more than one month under standard conditions. So, I expect you to complete a quality draft of intro+discussion in no more than **two weeks**.*
